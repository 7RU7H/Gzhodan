# README

Gzhodan is the G*-olang-*zombified Hyper-Optimized Daily Aggregating Newsreporter, because names are difficult, golang is good and Pseudo-Humaness is the objective. 


The hope is that this will become middleware for data-crunching, database and LLMs. For now and probably always this is just for CVE, Hacking, InfoSec, CyberSecurity information gathering from trusted URLs because all other news is just noise to a new zero day or vulnerability.
